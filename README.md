## Business Problem

This project is focused on utilizing data sciece methodologies to process and analyze a comprehensive dataset sourced from IMDB. It is enhanced with financial information retrieved through TMDB's API.The ultimate goal is to perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations on the raw data and building a MySQL database and export it into a set of CSV files. Leveraging machine learning models and hypothesis testing, goal is to extract valuable insights for stakeholders, providing guidance on strategies for achieving success in the realm of filmmaking with recommendations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Average revenue by Certification

### Average budget by Certification

## Hypothesis Testing

### Does MPAA ratings of movie affect the revenue?

- **`Hypothesis`**
    - ($H_0$) Null Hypothesis : The MPAA rating does not affect its revenue.
    - ($H_A$) Alternative Hypothesis : The MPAA rating of a movie does affect its revenue

- **`Select the right test based on data`**
    - 'revenue' (numeric)
    - 'certification' (categorical)
    - '2 groups'

- **`Test`**
    -  One Way ANOVA and/or Tukey
  
- **`ANOVA Assumptions`**
    - No significant outliers
    - Normality
    - Equal variance
 
- Significance level 0.05

**Outliers** - Removed from both the groups

**Normality Test**

- Assumption of Normality failed though, with sufficient samples in each group we can pass the test

**Equal Variance**

</p>

As we failed the assumtion of equal variance , we will use non parametric Kruskal Wallis instead of one-way ANOVA.

**Post-Hoc Tukey Comparisions**

**Based on the Tukey's comparision we can conclude that PG moveis make most revenue. NC-17 movies and R rated movies make significantly less as compared to other.**
